BIDMach is a very fast machine learning library. Check the latest <b><a href="https://github.com/BIDData/BIDMach/wiki/Benchmarks">benchmarks</a></b>

The github distribution contains source code only. You also need a jdk 8, an installation of NVIDIA CUDA 8.0 (if you want to use a GPU) and CUDNN 5 if you plan to use deep networks. For building you need <a href="https://maven.apache.org/docs/history.html">maven 3.X</a>.

After doing <code>git clone</code>, cd to the BIDMach directory, and build and install the jars with <code>mvn install</code>. You can then run bidmach with `./bidmach`. More details on installing and running are available <b><a href="https://github.com/BIDData/BIDMach/wiki/Installing-and-Running">here</a></b>.
