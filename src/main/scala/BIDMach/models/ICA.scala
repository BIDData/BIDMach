/**
 * Independent Component Analysis, using FastICA. It has the ability to center and whiten data. It is 
 * based on the method presented in:
 * 
 * A. Hyv채rinen and E. Oja. Independent Component Analysis: Algorithms and Applications. 
 * Neural Networks, 13(4-5):411-430, 2000.
 * 
 * In particular, we provide the logcosh, exponential, and kurtosis "G" functions.
 * 
 * This algorithm computes the following modelmats array:
 *   - modelmats(0) stores the inverse of the mixing matrix. If X = A*S represents the data, then it's the 
 *     estimated A^-1^, which we assume is square and invertible for now.
 *   - modelmats(1) stores the mean vector of the data, which is computed entirely on the first pass. This
 *     means once we estimate A^-1^ in modelmats(0), we need to first shift the data by this amount, and
 *     then multiply to recover the (centered) sources. Example:
 * {{{
 * modelmats(0) * (data - modelmats(1))
 * }}}
 *     Here, data is an n x N matrix, whereas modelmats(1) is an n x 1 matrix. For efficiency reasons, we
 *     assume a constant batch size for each block of data so we take the mean across all batches. This is 
 *     true except for (usually) the last batch, but this almost always isn't enough to make a difference.
 *     
 * Thus, modelmats(1) helps to center the data. The whitening in this algorithm happens during the updates
 * to W in both the orthogonalization and the fixed point steps. The former uses the computed covariance 
 * matrix and the latter relies on an approximation of W^T^*W to the inverse covariance matrix. It is fine
 * if the data is already pre-whitened before being passed to BIDMach.
 *     
 * Currently, we are thinking about the following extensions:
 *   - Allowing ICA to handle non-square mixing matrices. Most research about ICA assumes that A is n x n.
 *   - Improving the way we handle the computation of the mean, so it doesn't rely on the last batch being
 *     of similar size to all prior batches. Again, this is minor, especially for large data sets.
 *   - Thinking of ways to make this scale better to a large variety of datasets
 * 
 * For additional references, see Aapo Hyv채rinen's other papers, and visit:
 *   http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica/
